Implemented by Douwe Maan.

Modified by Duncan McKenzie.

Envisioned as a watchface by Jean-NoÃ«l Mattern (Jnm), who posted it in the ["Watch-face ideas" thread](http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/comment/3538/#Comment_3538) on the Pebble forums.

Based on the display of the [Freebox Revolution](http://www.free.fr/adsl/freebox-revolution.html), which was designed by Philippe Starck.

Modified to have inverted colours & retaining the DD-MM Date format
